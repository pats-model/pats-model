Parcel Ascent Tracing System (PATS) is the numerical model
for convective parcel ascent simulation in three-dimensions
developed as a Master's project at the School of Environmental
Sciences at the University of East Anglia.

The model predicts how convective air parcel behaves in conditions
much more realistic then those assumed by classical parcel theory.

**The model is currently under development.**

Check [technical documentation](tech-docs.md) for a detailed description of the model code.
